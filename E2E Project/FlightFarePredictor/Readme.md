# Flight Fare Predictor

To test the deployed model click [here](https://flight-fare-predict-ml2.herokuapp.com/).<br/>
Note : It takes some time to load the heroku page. Patience is the key!!

## Overview
- The dataset consists of records for different airlines,travel routes,stops,sources,destination,date of journeyprice,etc.Price is the target variable.This dataset is present on kaggle.Please check [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/)for more details on dataset. 

- The train dataset has about 10682 records. The test dataset is a different file and you will have to test on that. 

## Motivation
- I like to travel a lot. So for this purpose I thought it would be better if try to analyse this data and make a model out of it just for academic purpose.

-  This model would give you approximate fare value and not the exact!!

## Problem Objective
- To build a model which predict the prices of flight using the dataset

## Methodology

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
- Checked for NaN values.

- Required Graphs are plotted using seaborn,matplotlib libraries.

- Checked for data imbalance.

### Data Preprocessing
- I have used regular expressions to filter the data i.e removing unwanted commas,full-stops, special characters etc.

- Removed stop words from the corpus so that we don't train our model with unnecessary features.

- I have used Lemmatization for processing the words.

- Used TfIdf Vectorizer model to transform the features.

### Feature Engineering
- Transformed the target variable into binary.

- The data was imbalanced. So balanced the dataset using Over-Sampling method. I have used 'imblearn' library for this.

### Model Making

- I have prepared Naive Bayes Classifier and RandomForests Classifier models.

- I have chosen RandomForests Classifier as my final model as I got better results.

- I have tuned the hyperparameters i.e 'alpha' for NB Classifier and 'n_estimators' for RF Classifier by using GridSearchCV

- Further I have used StratifiedKFold as my cv to balance training and validation data.

### Metrics

- To check how many messages are correctly identified as spams and hams I have used confusion matrices for both models.

Correction : The image on right side is for RandomForestsClassifier instead of Naive Bayes.

- I have given importance to 'precision' score as we need to correct identify the spam message.eg : What if model detects a ham message as spam!!!The person would miss important message!!
